# DATA ANALYTICS PORTFOLIO
Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio. I am a data analyst with a strong interest in transforming data into clear metrics and actionable insights to support better business decisions. I use SQL to extract and model data, Python for cleaning and analysis (segmentation, funnel/cohort tracking, trend checks, basic statistical testing), and Power BI/Tableau/Excel to build dashboards and reports that stakeholders can use immediately. Each project in this portfolio presents the business question, the approach, key findings, and recommendations—supported by reproducible queries, notebooks, and visuals.
This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

## AtliQ Grands Revenue Performance Dashboard (Power BI)

**Goal:** Build an executive dashboard to track hotel revenue performance and identify the biggest levers for RevPAR growth (occupancy vs ADR), booking leakage (cancellations/realisation), platform mix, and property performance.  
**Tech:** Power BI (Power Query, DAX).  
**Output:** Interactive dashboard + insights and recommendations to improve occupancy, protect pricing, and reduce revenue leakage.


## Presence Insights Dashboard (Power BI)

**Goal:** Convert a multi-sheet Excel attendance tracker into standardized KPIs (Presence %, WFH %, Sick Leave %) and reveal trends, weekday patterns, and employee-level differences for HR decision-making.  
**Tech:** Power BI (Power Query, DAX), Excel.  
**Output:** Interactive attendance dashboard with KPI cards, trend views, weekday breakdowns, and employee comparisons.


## Sales Insights Dashboard (Power BI + MySQL)

**Goal:** Deliver reliable sales reporting (Revenue and Sales Quantity trends) and identify top/bottom markets, customers, and products, while validating the data to avoid misleading insights.  
**Tech:** MySQL (SQL), Power BI (data modeling, DAX).  
**Output:** Interactive sales dashboard + SQL-based data quality checks (invalid values, missing product mapping) and business recommendations.
