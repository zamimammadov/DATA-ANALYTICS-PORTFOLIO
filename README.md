# DATA ANALYTICS POTFOLIO
Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio. I am a data analyst with a strong interest in transforming data into clear metrics and actionable insights to support better business decisions. I use SQL to extract and model data, Python for cleaning and analysis (segmentation, funnel/cohort tracking, trend checks, basic statistical testing), and Power BI/Tableau/Excel to build dashboards and reports that stakeholders can use immediately. Each project in this portfolio presents the business question, the approach, key findings, and recommendations—supported by reproducible queries, notebooks, and visuals.
This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
