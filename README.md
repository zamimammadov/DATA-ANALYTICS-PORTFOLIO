# DATA ANALYTICS PORTFOLIO
Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio. I am a data analyst with a strong interest in transforming data into clear metrics and actionable insights to support better business decisions. I use SQL to extract and model data, Python for cleaning and analysis (segmentation, funnel/cohort tracking, trend checks, basic statistical testing), and Power BI/Tableau/Excel to build dashboards and reports that stakeholders can use immediately. Each project in this portfolio presents the business question, the approach, key findings, and recommendations—supported by reproducible queries, notebooks, and visuals.
This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

### [End to end](#End_to_end)
- **Hospitality Revenue Analytics Dashboard (AtliQ Grands)**
  - **Goal:** Track hotel revenue performance and identify the key levers for RevPAR growth (occupancy vs ADR), booking leakage (cancellations/realisation), platform mix, and property performance.
  - **Tech:** Power BI (Power Query, DAX).
  - **Output:** Executive dashboard + insights and recommendations to improve occupancy, protect pricing, and reduce revenue leakage.

- **Cricket Analysis**
  - **Goal:** Analyze cricket match/player performance to uncover patterns and summarize insights for decision-making.
  - **Tech:** Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib), Jupyter Notebook.
  - **Output:** Cleaned dataset + analysis notebook with visual insights.

---

### Python
- **Goal:** Demonstrate Python-based analytics workflows (cleaning, EDA, visualization, and small ML where needed).
- **Tech:** Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib), Jupyter Notebook.
- **Output:** Reproducible notebooks with clear steps and results.

---

### SQL
- **Goal:** Write reliable KPI queries and validate data quality for reporting (joins, aggregations, and advanced patterns when needed).
- **Tech:** SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL-style), CTEs, window functions.
- **Output:** Query files + documented metric logic and validation checks.

---

### Excel / Google Sheets
- **Goal:** Build fast reporting using spreadsheets with consistent KPI logic and clean structures.
- **Tech:** Excel / Google Sheets (PivotTables, Power Query, XLOOKUP/SUMIFS).
- **Output:** KPI summaries and lightweight dashboards (exported screenshots/PDFs).

---

### Tableau
- **Goal:** Communicate insights using interactive visualizations and stakeholder-ready dashboards.
- **Tech:** Tableau (calculated fields, filters, dashboard layout).
- **Output:** Dashboard(s) + short written summary of insights.

---

### Power BI

#### HR Analytics
- **Presence Insights Dashboard**
  - **Goal:** Convert a multi-sheet Excel attendance tracker into standardized KPIs (Presence %, WFH %, Sick Leave %) and reveal trends, weekday patterns, and employee-level differences.
  - **Tech:** Power BI (Power Query, DAX), Excel.
  - **Output:** Interactive HR dashboard with KPI cards, trends, weekday breakdowns, and employee comparisons.

#### Sales Analytics
- **Sales Insights Dashboard**
  - **Goal:** Deliver reliable sales reporting (Revenue and Sales Quantity trends) and identify top/bottom markets, customers, and products while validating data quality.
  - **Tech:** MySQL (SQL), Power BI (data modeling, DAX).
  - **Output:** Interactive sales dashboard + SQL-based data checks (invalid values, missing mappings) and recommendations.
