# DATA ANALYTICS POTFOLIO
Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio. I’m a data analyst who helps teams make better business decisions through clear metrics, reliable datasets, and actionable insights. I use SQL to extract and model data, Python/R for cleaning and analysis (segmentation, funnel/cohort tracking, trend checks, basic statistical testing), and Power BI/Tableau/Excel to build dashboards and reports that stakeholders can use immediately. Each project in this portfolio presents the business question, the approach, key findings, and recommendations—supported by reproducible queries, notebooks, and visuals.
