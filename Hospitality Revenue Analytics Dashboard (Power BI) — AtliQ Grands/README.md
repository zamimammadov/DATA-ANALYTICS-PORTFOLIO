## Project Background
AtliQ Grands is a multi-city hotel chain. The Revenue team needs a clear way to monitor performance and take action on the right levers (pricing, occupancy, category mix, booking platforms, cancellations, and guest experience).

## Executive Summary
This analysis reviews **AtliQ Grands’ performance in 2022 (Weeks W19–W32)** using a Power BI dashboard built on booking-level and room-night data. During this period, the portfolio generated **1.71bn** in revenue with **RevPAR 7.35K**, **ADR 12.70K**, **Occupancy 57.87%**, and **Realisation 70.15%**. Revenue is mainly driven by the **Luxury** segment (**61.61%, 1.05bn**) compared to **Business** (**38.39%, 0.66bn**), while weekends show stronger utilization than weekdays. A key risk is booking leakage through cancellations (**24.84% overall**) and uneven property performance, so improving platform mix (higher-realisation channels) and targeting low-rating/high-cancellation properties will help protect realized revenue and lift RevPAR.

## Insights Deep-Dive

### Revenue Trend and Category Mix (Business vs Luxury)
- For **2022 (W19–W32)**, AtliQ Grands generated **1.71bn** total revenue.
- Revenue is driven mainly by the **Luxury** segment: **1.05bn (61.61%)**, while **Business** contributes **0.66bn (38.39%)**.
- Across the weekly trend view, **Luxury consistently stays above Business**, meaning overall revenue movement is more sensitive to Luxury demand/pricing changes.
- There is a **sharp revenue drop in W32** for both categories, which likely indicates a **partial week / missing data** rather than a true performance crash (should be validated in the raw data).
- Implication: to lift total revenue, the highest leverage is to **protect Luxury performance** (availability, pricing, and experience), while using Business as a **stability lever** (weekday/corporate demand) to smooth volatility.
